jigdoo does a jig, without the jag

optimised replacement of jigdo

uses wget, like jigdo, but other external libraries are reduced and/or removed (mostly, due to bloat)

creates a database in the target directory for better batch mode management of multiple .jigdo files.

uses the same .jigdo file format, pending license compatibility, otherwise a new format will be used.

naming of jigdoo came about due to my internal pronunciation of 'jigdo' being pronounced as 'jig-doe'
